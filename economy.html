                    <h2>ECONOMY</h2>
                    <p>Sudan is endowed with significant natural resources, including oil and minerals. Oil production was a major contributor to the country's revenue until the secession of South Sudan in 2011, which resulted in the loss of a significant portion of oil reserves.Oil had been a crucial source of revenue for Sudan prior to the secession of South Sudan. Following the separation, the country faced economic challenges due to the loss of oil-related income.
                        The government has sought to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on oil exports.Sudan has substantial mineral resources, including gold, copper, chromium ore, and uranium. The mining sector has the potential to contribute significantly to economic growth.
                        Gold production, in particular, has become a major source of revenue, with Sudan ranking among Africa's leading gold producers.</p>
