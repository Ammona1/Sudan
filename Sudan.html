                    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>The region that is now Sudan was home to ancient civilizations, most notably the Kingdom of Kush. The Kingdom of Kush flourished along the Nile River from around 1070 BCE to 350 CE. It was a powerful state that traded with ancient Egypt and later conquered it, ruling as the 25th Dynasty.In the 6th century CE, the Kingdom of Kush eventually declined, and the region saw the spread of Christianity. Christian kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Alodia, emerged in the northern part of present-day Sudan.
                        By the 14th century, the Islamic influence began to spread through trade and migration, leading to the conversion of many Sudanese to Islam.In the 19th century, Sudan experienced the Turkiyah period, during which Egypt, under Ottoman rule, sought to control the Sudanese territories. Muhammad Ali of Egypt sent forces to Sudan, marking the beginning of Egyptian influence.In the late 19th century, Sudan witnessed the Mahdist Revolution led by Muhammad Ahmad. The Mahdists successfully defeated the Egyptian-Ottoman forces, and Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed himself the Mahdi (the guided one). This period of Mahdist rule lasted from 1885 until the British-Egyptian reconquest in 1898.</p>
