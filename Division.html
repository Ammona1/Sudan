                    <p>Northern Sudan traditionally referred to the predominantly Arab and Muslim part of the country. This region includes cities such as Khartoum, the capital, and has historically been the center of political power and economic activity.Southern Sudan was historically characterized by ethnic and cultural diversity, with a significant Christian and animist population. This region played a central role in the North-South civil war, which lasted for several decades and ultimately led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011.The transitional areas, such as the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile state, have seen conflicts and have been designated as transitional zones with special administrative arrangements.</p>
